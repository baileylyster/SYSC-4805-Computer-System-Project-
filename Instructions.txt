Instructions:

In the models folder the 'FinalRobot' is our final model for the robot. To import into CoppeliaSim, open the desired map,
then under File->Load Model... select FinalRobot.ttm from the Models folder.
This is the robot that will be loaded into the test maps. 
The robot should start at the proper coordinates but incase it does not, The coordinates are as follows:

						X: 0
						Y: -6.28
						Z: 0.4

We use Python API. In order to run this robot, you must have a python IDE installed. 
In python you can open this project. Run the CoppeliaSim simulator then run the mainScript.py in the Main_Scripts folder using python. 
In the terminal it will ask you to press enter then the simulation will begin, 
this is so a timer can be started before the robot begins.

Note: This robot will not handle higher simulation speeds properly due to API connection limitations.
Please use default speed on real time!
